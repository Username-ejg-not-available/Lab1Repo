A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away

Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped upside-down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And shooting some b-ball outside of the school
