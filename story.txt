A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away

Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped upsidedown
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And shooting some b-ball outside of the school

Honestly the Han Solo movie wasn't horrible,
but it's a load of BS that it ended with that
cliffhangar with Darth Maul and then all the sequels
got cancelled. This is like that time when they made
the latter 4 Percy Jackson books into one movie
because they knew they weren't going to be able to
make more movies, except in PJ's case, they actually
still made a sequel, and also the first PJ movie was
actually unwatchable compared to Solo
